Hello!

This is the Placeholder testrepo.

Task is:

  1. Pick a small task (emphasis on small - you can pick one problem out of Project Euler if you wish, but make sure you don't have to spend a long time coding it!)
  2. Create a new branch for your small addition 
  3. Implement it in programming language of your choice
  4. Ask another group member to write a unit test (in your branch)
  5. Make sure to merge with head
  6. Make sure somebody reviews the code
